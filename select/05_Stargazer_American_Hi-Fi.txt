As the tires hit the road
I can navigate the burning snow
On a phantom way
We'll glide until we melt and flow
Frozen you have chosen to be here
So as the misery takes hold
Swallow, drink it down
It doesn't seem to hurt as much
Until you hit the ground
Follow me, we'll hide behind the sun
The sky is breaking through
The uni will fight to shine
Beneath the dying moon
We learn, we own a taste for crime
Broken we are spoken, come on blue
So as the misery takes hold
Swallow, drink it down
It doesn't seem to hurt as much
Until you hit the ground
Follow me, we'll hide behind the sun
Well nobody seems to know
We suffered enough
Need to make the pitch black hours
Welcome the silence inside
Welcome the silence inside
So as the misery takes hold
Swallow, drink it down
It doesn't seem to hurt as much
Until you hit the ground
Follow me, we'll hide behind the sun
Follow me, we'll hide behind the sun
Follow me, we'll hide
