He was a star collector, she knew about the skies
He was a tightrope walker, she was the talk of the town
While he was in the clouds he'd show her the signs
And he know what they mean
Twinkle twinkle little dream
Stargazer, heart breaker, wish you were here
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
She had it all and lost it, now is forever in space
He circles Halley's comet and lights up the sky like a flame
Now she's a star collector, she knows the signs
And she knows what they mean
Twinkle twinkle little dream
Stargazer, heart breaker, wish you were here
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
In my everyday, and the moment I wake up beyond me
You're the only one who can bring me stars for me
Twinkle twinkle little dream
My little dream
Stargazer, heart breaker, wish you were here
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
Give me a shooting star
And I'll make a wish
I'll make a wish for you
How will I shine anymore, when you're not here?
